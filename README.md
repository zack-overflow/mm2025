# March Madness Player Predictions

You select 15 players on teams participating in the 2025 NCAA Tournament.  You receive points for how many points they score in each game that they play.  However, players on lower seeds give you a multiple.  That is what makes it interesting, dynamic, and down right a party atmosphere. 
Also, it is important to note that players can be on multiple teams (e.g., Dan and Tyler can both pick Cooper Flagg from Duke.)  Remember not to pick players who are on teams that didnâ€™t qualify for the Tournament.
 
[And play-in games don't count.] 
 
Here is the scoring:
#1-#5 Seeds: 1X the players points
#6-#12 Seeds: 2X the players points
#13-#16 Seeds: 3X the players points
