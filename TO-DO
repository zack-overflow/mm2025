Docket:
* Read played tournaments/competitions and backtest selection methods
    * Only really possible with kenpom data since they go back further
    * Will probably need to capitalize all names to ensure compatibility
    * Q: How does number of participants impact the risk we should take on?
* Learn empirical distribution of player points
* Use Player class instead of dictionary and have Team objects store roster of players
* Decouple program's design from structure of data sources (EE)
    * Region is just a small tournament
    * Matchup should be a node
* Make model internally consistent (i.e. update team ratings based of games during the simulation)
* Parallelize simulations

Done:
[x] Keep track of player points
[x] Select best players
